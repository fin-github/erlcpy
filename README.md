  # ERLC.py

The **BEST** way of communicating with ER:LC through the API with py.

ERLC.py has unloose and specific classes for specific needs!

Things ERLC.py can do:
- [x] Get The Status Of A Server
- [x] Get The Amount Of Players
- [x] Get All Players AND they're info.
- [x] Get join logs (with specific date classes and more)
- [x] Run any command automatically, with debugging.
- [ ] The only ERLC API package that has BUILT IN adaptive rate limiting, adjusting with EVERY request!



Be careful on how much you are using the API.
