# ERLC.py
The **BEST** way of communicating with ER:LC through the API with py.

ERLC.py has unloose and specific classes for specific needs!

Things ERLC.py can do:
- [x] Get The Status Of A Server
- [x] Get The Amount Of Players
- [x] Get All Players AND they're info.
- [x] Get join logs (with specific date classes and more)
- [x] Run any command automatically, with debugging.
- [x] The only ERLC API package that has BUILT IN adaptive rate limiting, adjusting with EVERY request!


### NOTICE
Currently ERLC.py FULLY works!
But with that, ERLC.py misses some coverage.
Sorry!
