# ERLC.py

# DISCONTINUED!!!
This project has been discontinued.
Although, I will be making a new ERLC.py in async so there will be ratelimit handling.
There should be a scalable demo out soon, because I am kinda motivated for this!


The **BEST** way of communicating with ER:LC through the API with py.

ERLC.py has unloose and specific classes for specific needs!

Things ERLC.py can do:
- [x] Get The Status Of A Server
- [x] Get The Amount Of Players
- [x] Get All Players AND they're info.
- [x] Get join logs (with specific date classes and more)
- [x] Run any command automatically, with debugging.
- [ ] The only ERLC API package that has BUILT IN adaptive rate limiting, adjusting with EVERY request!



Be careful on how much you are using the API.
