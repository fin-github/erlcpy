# ERLC.py
The **BEST** way of communicating with ER:LC through the API.

ERLC.py has unloose and specific classes for specific needs!

Things ERLC.py can do:
- [x] Get The Status Of A Server
- [x] Get The Amount Of Players
- [x] Get All Players AND they're info.
- [x] Get join logs (with specific date classes and more)
- [x] Run any command automatically, with debugging.


### NOTICE
ERLC.py has not been tested much.
I don't want to spend 600 robux on an API Pack for a server.
If you have a server with the API pack, I would love to use it, if I can.
